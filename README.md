AstroGen is a procedural asteroid generator built with Bevy, offering fine-grained control over the asteroid's shape. Customize features like the number of craters, the formation of ridges, and more to create unique asteroid models. The project is inspired by Sebastian Lague's tutorial, which you can check out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lctXaT9pxA0&t=618s).
